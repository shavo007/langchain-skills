## Tables

### customers
- customer_id (PRIMARY KEY)
- name
- email
- signup_date
- status (active/inactive)
- customer_tier (bronze/silver/gold/platinum)

### orders
- order_id (PRIMARY KEY)
- customer_id (FOREIGN KEY -> customers)
- order_date
- status (pending/completed/cancelled/refunded)
- total_amount
- sales_region (north/south/east/west)

### order_items
- item_id (PRIMARY KEY)
- order_id (FOREIGN KEY -> orders)
- product_id
- quantity
- unit_price
- discount_percent

## Business Logic

**Active customers**: status = 'active' AND signup_date <= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'

**Revenue calculation**: Only count orders with status = 'completed'. Use total_amount from orders table, which already accounts for discounts.

**Customer lifetime value (CLV)**: Sum of all completed order amounts for a customer.

**High-value orders**: Orders with total_amount > 1000

## Example Query

-- Get top 10 customers by revenue in the last quarter
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.name,
    c.customer_tier,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_revenue
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.status = 'completed'
  AND o.order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '3 months'
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name, c.customer_tier
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;""",

## Tables

### products
- product_id (PRIMARY KEY)
- product_name
- sku
- category
- unit_cost
- reorder_point (minimum stock level before reordering)
- discontinued (boolean)

### warehouses
- warehouse_id (PRIMARY KEY)
- warehouse_name
- location
- capacity

### inventory
- inventory_id (PRIMARY KEY)
- product_id (FOREIGN KEY -> products)
- warehouse_id (FOREIGN KEY -> warehouses)
- quantity_on_hand
- last_updated

### stock_movements
- movement_id (PRIMARY KEY)
- product_id (FOREIGN KEY -> products)
- warehouse_id (FOREIGN KEY -> warehouses)
- movement_type (inbound/outbound/transfer/adjustment)
- quantity (positive for inbound, negative for outbound)
- movement_date
- reference_number

## Business Logic

**Available stock**: quantity_on_hand from inventory table where quantity_on_hand > 0

**Products needing reorder**: Products where total quantity_on_hand across all warehouses is less than or equal to the product's reorder_point

**Active products only**: Exclude products where discontinued = true unless specifically analyzing discontinued items

**Stock valuation**: quantity_on_hand * unit_cost for each product

## Example Query

-- Find products below reorder point across all warehouses
SELECT
    p.product_id,
    p.product_name,
    p.reorder_point,
    SUM(i.quantity_on_hand) as total_stock,
